# Awesome ANTI Burnout

Burnout isn't awesome. Here are resources to help you recognise, reduce, and prevent burnout. I have 8 years' experience in tech but hopefully this will be relevant to many other industries.

Please contribute or leave feedback by making [pull requests](https://github.com/vlvagerviwager/awesome-anti-burnout/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/vlvagerviwager/awesome-anti-burnout/issues). 

Remember that there is no substitute for talking to supportive friends/family, or a professional trained to help you with your mental wellbeing.
